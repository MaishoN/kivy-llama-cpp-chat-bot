- needs a llama.cpp build (+set path to llama-cli in config.ini)
- needs a .gguf model (models folder by default +set file name in config.ini)
- technically needs other tweaks to config.ini options to work properly with a specific model (is set up for gemma right now) 
- needs kivymd (pip install kivymd)
- idk what python version but I used 3.11
